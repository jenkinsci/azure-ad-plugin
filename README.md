# Microsoft Entra ID Plugin (previously Azure Active Directory Plugin)

> ***Important***: This plug-in is maintained by the Jenkins community and wonâ€™t be supported by Microsoft as of February 29, 2024.

A Jenkins Plugin that supports authentication & authorization via Microsoft Entra ID ([previously known as Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/new-name)).

## Setup In Microsoft Entra ID

1. Open `Microsoft Entra ID`, click `App registrations`

1. Click `New registration`

1. Add a new Reply URL `https://{your_jenkins_host}/securityRealm/finishLogin`. Make sure "Jenkins URL" (Manage Jenkins => Configure System) is set to the same value as `https://{your_jenkins_host}`.

1. Click `Certificates & secrets`, under Client secrets click `New client secret` to generate a new key, copy the `value`, it will be used as `Client Secret` in Jenkins.

1. Click `Authentication`, under 'Implicit grant and hybrid flows', enable `ID tokens`.

1. (optional) To enable Microsoft Entra ID group support: Click `Manifest` and modify the `"groupMembershipClaims": null` value to `"groupMembershipClaims": "SecurityGroup"`, then 'Save' it.

### Setup Microsoft Entra ID permissions (optional, but recommended)

In order for Jenkins to be able to lookup data from Microsoft Entra ID it needs some Graph API permissions.

This is used for:

* Autocompleting users and groups on the 'Security' page
* Jenkins looking up the user, e.g. when you use the Rest API
* Group display name support (rather than just object ID)

_Note: You can skip this part and just use the claims returned when authenticating._

1. Click `API permissions`

1. Add a permission

1. Microsoft Graph

1. Application permissions

1. Add 'User.Read.All', 'Group.Read.All' and 'People.Read.All'

1. Click `Grant admin consent`. If you are not an admin in your tenant, please contact an admin to grant the permissions.

## Setup In Jenkins

Click `Manage Jenkins` in the left menu, then click `Security`

## Authentication

1. Check `Azure Active Directory` and fill in the credential.

1. Click `Verify Application` to make sure your input is valid.

1. Save the configuration, (logged-in users will have permission to do anything)

1. Log in with Microsoft Entra ID

1. Return to 'Security' to configure authorization

_Note: if you haven't setup Graph API permissions, verify application will fail, skip over this step_

## Authorization

Jenkins will match permissions based on the Object ID of a user or group.

This plugin extends the traditional [Matrix Authorization Strategy](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matrix-auth/)
with the ability to search by users / groups by display name when configuring the authorization rules.

To use this feature:

1. Click `Azure Active Directory Matrix-based security`
1. Search for user in 'Azure User/group to add' and click Add
1. Select the permission(s) in the table
1. Click 'Apply'

You can still use other authorization strategies such as:

* [Matrix Authorization Strategy](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matrix-auth/)
* [Folder-based Authorization Strategy](https://plugins.jenkins.io/folder-auth/)
* [Role-based Authorization Strategy](https://plugins.jenkins.io/role-strategy/)

The following can normally be used:

* Object ID of user or group
* Display name of group (Only if Graph API permissions granted)
* `preferred_username` claim which is normally the 'User principal name', but not always.
* User principal name (Rest API authentication only)

## Configuration as Code and Job DSL support
The plugin has full support for use in Configuration as Code and Job DSL.

For an example combining the two, see the [configuration-as-code.yml](./src/test/resources/com/microsoft/jenkins/azuread/integrations/casc/configuration-as-code.yml) test resource.

## FAQ
#### Q: How to recover if Jenkins keeps failing during the login phase?
A: You can disable the security from the config file (see [https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/access-control/disable/](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/access-control/disable/))

#### Q: Why am I getting an error "insufficient privileges to complete the operation" even after having granted the permission?

A: It can take a long time for the privileges to take effect, which could be 10-20 minutes. Just wait for a while and try again.
