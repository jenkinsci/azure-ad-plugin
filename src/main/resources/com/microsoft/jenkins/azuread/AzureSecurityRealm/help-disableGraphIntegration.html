To support group based authentication and searching for users to grant permissions this plugin
needs some graph API permissions:

<ul>
    <li>People.Read</li>
    <li>User.Read.All</li>
    <li>Group.Read.All</li>
</ul>

If you can't grant these permissions you will want to disable this feature so that:

<ul>
    <li>Your logs aren't full of permission errors</li>
    <li>A different component is used for filling in users that allows free text</li>
</ul>
